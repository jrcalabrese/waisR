In Fall 2021, I took a course on psychological assessment at Ohio State and decided to make a tool to create visualizations for my reports. In the future, I want to add a table-maker so you can export APA-style tables automatically.

I hope to submit this to the 2022 Shiny Contest. Suggestions welcome.
